# Ogre - C2 Server and Agents

The purpose of this project is for me to learn to build a C2 server and agents for Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Additionally, there's some other goals such as getting better at C programming (it has been a long time), use ICMP and other protocols for unintended purposes, writing Windows agents to evade detection, and joining in the fun of everyone else building C2 software.

Almost a spec here https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/, it would be cool to support most of the things there. Some things I don't know how to do yet, but having a project is a great way to figure it out!
